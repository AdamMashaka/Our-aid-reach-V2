- Solidity: Programming smart contracts to facilitate automatic currency release.
- Web3.js: Interacting with the smart contracts from the frontend.
- React.js: Building a user-friendly frontend interface .

## Project Structure

The Tz blocker project's key functionalities are implemented through a well-structured architecture, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness across its components. The project's core features are distributed as follows:

- `Smart_Contract/contracts/AidFlow.sol`: This smart contract serves as the foundation of AidFlow, facilitating donations and rewarding contributors with AidTokens. It ensures transparency and security in fund transactions.

- `Smart_Contract/contracts/Governance/AidGovernance.sol`: This contract orchestrates the democratic decision-making process, enabling users to propose and vote on critical AidReach initiatives.

- `Smart_Contract/contracts/Governance/TimelockContract.sol`: Ensuring safety and measured decision-making, this contract enforces time delays on sensitive functions, enhancing the security of the governance process.

- `Smart_Contract/tasks/get-address.js`: A task-based utility script that seamlessly generates Filecoin f4 addresses and corresponding Ethereum addresses. This supports smooth cross-ecosystem interactions.

- `Smart_Contract/deploy/deploy.js`: The primary deployment script responsible for deploying AidFlow's core contracts, including AidFlow, GovernanceToken, AidGovernance, and TimelockContract.

In addition to the smart contract architecture, the frontend components play a pivotal role in ensuring user-friendly interactions:

- `Frontend/components/Donate.js`: This frontend component empowers donors to contribute funds effortlessly, supporting the seamless flow of donations.

- `Frontend/components/NGOProposals.js`: A frontend component designed for NGOs, enabling them to submit aid proposals and actively engage in the decision-making process.

The project's well-organized structure ensures the efficient integration of both smart contract and frontend elements, creating a cohesive ecosystem that advances philanthropy and governance on the blockchain.
